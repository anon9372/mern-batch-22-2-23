What is Asyc Javascript?
-> Handles multiple tasks simultaneously
-> Allows a program to continue working on other task while waiting for external events, such as Network Reqs.


What are the types of Asyn JS?

1) Callback function 
2) Promises 
3) Asyc/Await 


1) Callback function: it is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the first function has completed its execution.

const newFunc = (newCallback) => {
// I will perform my tasks and give output
//newCallback(output)

}

const newCallback = () => {
    
}


--> Callback Hell: When multiple Callbacks are nested within then that leads to callback hell it is also know as 'Pyramid of Doom'

getData(function (a)) {
    getMoreData(a, function(b)) {
        getEvenMoreData(b, function(c)){
            getEvenEvenMoreData(c, function(d)) {
                console.log(finalData)
            }
        }
    }
}


2) Promises: it is a way of handling async operations in an organized way. It is similar to CB but offers additional capabilities and the syntax is more readable..


        There are 3 states in promises: 
            1) Pending: Initail state, which is neither fullfilled or rejected
            2) Fullfilled: Promise is executed successfully
            3) Rejected: Promise failed

How to create a promise: 

    const myPromise = new Promise(function (res, rej) {

    })

     const myPromise = new Promise(function (res, rej) {
       setTimeout(() => {
         res('This is a promise')
       }, 2000)
    })
 
 console.log(myPromise)

  Creating a promise with Fetch APIs 

    fetch ('http://random-api.com')  -> [{}, {}, {}]
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => {console.log(data)})

        .catch(err => {
            console.log(err)
        })


3) Asyc/Await: it allows us to write async code in a more sync  and readable way.

 async -> a keyword that is used to declare a function as async
 await -> a keyword that is used inside the async function to pause the execution of the function until the promise is executed

 const getData = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('http://random-api.com')
    const data = await res.json()
    console.log(data)
 }

 getData()
